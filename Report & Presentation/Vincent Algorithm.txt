Vincent Algorithm

phase 1: Tele-operated
- Start VNC viewer
- Start Arduino IDE and Serial Monitor
- Start hector slam 
- Set CPU limit of hector slam and rviz to 80

- Command Vincent to navigate through the maze according to the map shown on rviz
	- Mark location
	- Store commands to "log.txt" on the SD card
	- if (cmd == '<') start backtracking

- Problem: Build a map representation of the environment and simultaneously localize the 	robot within that map:
- SLAM: simultaneous localization and mapping
- hector SLAM: compare and align the picture from current lidar data to previous 
	- advantage: does not require odometry data

phase 2: Autonomous backtracking
- Read from last line of "log.txt" to the first line of "log.txt" on the SD card

	- Inverse all turning directions
	- Play a cue at marked locations for 2 seconds
